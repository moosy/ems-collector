This work is based on the ems-collectord by Danny Baumann.
This is a experimental fork in order to make my research 
available to the public as soon as possible.

Furthermore this version is needed in order to drive
my PHP-based Webinterface.

This fork may have some features the original branch from
danny does not have, but also may not be as stable and
thourouhly designed as the main branch by Danny.

The main goal is to add all the features of this release to 
the main branch, so this fork will become obsolete.

Please note that I am a lousy C++ programmer and feel free
to improve the code wherever applicable.
